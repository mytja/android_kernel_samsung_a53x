	  Debug snapshot supports SoC debugging easily. This feature supports
	  to trace kernel events and other module events such frequceny change
	  and IPC. This supports to save GPR and PC when panic or exception and
	  to enter ramdump mode when panic is occurred and other exception.
	  This supports to reserve memory for h/w debug feature such as
	  scan2dram, arraydump.

	  This is for weight ligntening of ramdump. If DRAM size is too big,
	  Ramdump is also big. Then it takes a long time to get ramdump.
	  So we get important data such as dss logging and H/W raw data.
	  If you access text symbol and stack data, you could get them.
